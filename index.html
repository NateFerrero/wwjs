 <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
 <h2>What is OpenAI?</h2>
 <p>
  OpenAI is a research organization that conducts research in the field of
  artificial intelligence (AI). It was founded in 2015 with the goal of
  advancing AI in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity. OpenAI conducts
  research in a variety of areas within AI, including machine learning,
  robotics, and economics. Some of the organization's notable achievements
  include the development of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
  language model, which has achieved state-of-the-art results in a number of
  natural language processing tasks, and the development of the DALL-E
  artificial intelligence program, which can generate original artwork based on
  a written description. OpenAI is committed to making its research open and
  accessible to the public and regularly releases its research findings and code
  to the community.
 </p>
 <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
 <p>
  ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language
  model developed by OpenAI. Like the original GPT model, ChatGPT is a machine
  learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of human-generated
  text and is able to generate human-like text when provided with a prompt.
  However, ChatGPT has been specifically optimized for the task of generating
  text in a conversational context. This means that it is able to generate text
  that is more appropriate for use in chatbots and other conversational systems.
  ChatGPT works by using a transformer architecture, which is a type of neural
  network that is designed to process sequential data such as text. When
  provided with a prompt, ChatGPT processes the input text and uses its internal
  knowledge of language and context to generate a response that is appropriate
  to the conversation. ChatGPT is able to generate text that is coherent and
  flows naturally, making it an effective tool for use in chatbot systems and
  other conversational AI applications.
 </p>
 <h2>Is ChatGPT updated regularly?</h2>
 <p>
  It is not clear whether ChatGPT is being actively developed or updated on a
  regular basis. OpenAI regularly releases updates to its language models,
  including the original GPT model, but it is not clear whether these updates
  also apply to ChatGPT. It is possible that ChatGPT is no longer being actively
  developed or maintained by OpenAI. In general, language models like GPT and
  ChatGPT are trained on large datasets of human-generated text and are able to
  learn about language and context from this data. As a result, they are able to
  generate text that is coherent and flows naturally. However, the quality of
  the generated text may vary depending on the specific task or prompt, and the
  model may not always generate text that is completely accurate or appropriate.
  It is important to keep this in mind when using language models like ChatGPT.
 </p>
 <h2>What does ChatGPT know about the Bible and Jesus Christ of Nazareth?</h2>
 <p>
  As a language model, ChatGPT has been trained on a large dataset of
  human-generated text and has learned about language and context from this
  data. This includes information about the Bible and Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
  However, it is important to keep in mind that ChatGPT is a machine learning
  model and does not have personal beliefs or knowledge in the same way that a
  human does. It is able to generate text based on the patterns and information
  it has learned from the training data, but it is not able to form its own
  opinions or understand the deeper meaning or significance of the information
  it has learned. As such, ChatGPT may be able to generate text that mentions
  the Bible and Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and may be able to provide some basic
  information about these subjects based on what it has learned from the
  training data. However, it is not able to provide a deeper understanding or
  interpretation of this information. It is always important to carefully
  consider the source and limitations of any information when using language
  models like ChatGPT.
 </p>
 <h2>Who is Jesus Christ?</h2>
 <p>
  Jesus Christ, also known as Jesus of Nazareth or simply Jesus, is a religious
  figure who is central to the beliefs of Christianity. According to the New
  Testament of the Bible, Jesus was a Jewish teacher and prophet who lived in
  the 1st century AD in the region of Judea, which is now part of modern-day
  Israel. Christians believe that Jesus is the son of God and the savior of
  humanity. According to the Gospels, Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary, a
  virgin, and was conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit. He was raised
  in Nazareth and began his ministry in Galilee, where he preached about the
  kingdom of God and performed miracles such as healing the sick and casting out
  demons. He was eventually crucified in Jerusalem under the orders of the Roman
  Governor Pontius Pilate, but Christians believe that he rose from the dead
  three days later and ascended into heaven. The teachings and actions of Jesus
  have had a significant impact on the development of Christianity and continue
  to be an important source of inspiration and guidance for many people around
  the world.
 </p>
 <h2>What is the Bible?</h2>
 <p>
  The Bible is a collection of religious texts that are considered sacred by
  Christians. It is divided into two main sections: the Old Testament, which
  contains the Hebrew Scriptures, and the New Testament, which contains the
  teachings and actions of Jesus and the early Christian church. The Old
  Testament contains texts that are considered important by both Jews and
  Christians and is divided into three main sections: the Law, the Prophets, and
  the Writings. It includes texts such as the Torah (also known as the
  Pentateuch), which contains the first five books of the Bible and is
  considered the foundational text of Judaism; the historical books, which
  recount the history of the Israelites; and the poetic and prophetic books,
  which contain the teachings and prophecies of the Hebrew prophets. The New
  Testament contains texts that are specific to Christianity and is divided into
  four main sections: the Gospels, which contain accounts of the life and
  teachings of Jesus; the Acts of the Apostles, which describe the spread of the
  Christian message after Jesus' death; the letters (also known as the
  Epistles), which contain teachings and guidance for the early Christian
  church; and the book of Revelation, which contains a vision of the end of the
  world and the return of Jesus. The Bible is an important religious text for
  millions of people around the world and is considered a source of inspiration
  and guidance for many. It is widely translated and is available in many
  different languages.
 </p>
 <h2>When was Jesus on the Earth?</h2>
 <p>
  Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Jesus Christ, is believed to have lived in
  the 1st century AD. The exact dates of his birth and death are not known, but
  it is generally believed that he was born around 4 BC and died around 30-33
  AD. These dates are based on historical and biblical accounts of Jesus' life
  and the events that took place during his lifetime. According to the New
  Testament, Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the region of Judea, which is now
  part of modern-day Israel. He was raised in the nearby town of Nazareth and
  began his ministry in Galilee, where he preached about the kingdom of God and
  performed miracles such as healing the sick and casting out demons. He was
  eventually crucified in Jerusalem under the orders of the Roman Governor
  Pontius Pilate, but Christians believe that he rose from the dead three days
  later and ascended into heaven.
 </p>
 <h2>Did Jesus teach us how to pray?</h2>
 <p>
  Yes, according to the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus taught his followers
  how to pray. One of the most famous examples of this is the "Lord's Prayer,"
  which is also known as the "Our Father" prayer. This prayer is recorded in the
  Gospels of Matthew and Luke and is considered a central part of Christian
  liturgy and devotion. The Lord's Prayer begins with the words "Our Father,"
  which reflects Jesus' teaching that God is a loving and caring parent. The
  prayer then goes on to ask God to bless and protect his people, to forgive
  their sins, and to provide for their needs. It concludes with a request for
  God's help in overcoming temptation and evil. In addition to the Lord's
  Prayer, Jesus also taught his followers about the importance of prayer and the
  power of faith. He encouraged them to pray and to trust in God's guidance and
  protection. The teachings of Jesus about prayer and faith continue to be an
  important part of the Christian faith and are followed by millions of people
  around the world.
 </p>
 <h2>What is the full text of the Lord's Prayer?</h2>
 <p>
  The Lord's Prayer, also known as the "Our Father" prayer, is a central part of
  Christian liturgy and devotion. It is recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and
  Luke in the New Testament of the Bible. The full text of the Lord's Prayer is
  as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be
  done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive
  us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into
  temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This prayer begins with the words "Our Father," which reflects Jesus' teaching
  that God is a loving and caring parent. It then goes on to ask God to bless
  and protect his people, to forgive their sins, and to provide for their needs.
  It concludes with a request for God's help in overcoming temptation and evil.
  The Lord's Prayer is often recited by Christians as a way of expressing their
  devotion and seeking guidance and protection from God.

 <h4>CONTENTS</h4>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Note: In each case, ChatGPT responds with text before and after providing a
   selection of Bible verses. I have removed the surrounding text from each list
   of verses, and only included the list of verses in each answer. An example of
   the text response around the verses (in this example the question is about
   immigration and border control), which has been removed is:
  </p>
  <p>
   The Bible does not directly address the issue of immigration and border
   control in the same way that it is debated in modern societies. However,
   there are a number of passages in the Bible that address related issues such
   as the promotion of justice and compassion, the importance of loving one's
   neighbor, and the value of human life. Some people argue that these passages
   can help us understand what Jesus might say about immigration and border
   control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some examples of passages in the Bible that relate to these issues include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li><em>verses listed here</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   These passages suggest that Jesus would view immigration and border control
   as issues that are related to the promotion of justice and compassion, the
   importance of loving one's neighbor, and the value of human life. Some people
   argue that Jesus' teachings about the importance of loving one's neighbor and
   the promotion of justice and compassion would require a more nuanced approach
   to immigration and border control that takes into account the complex
   circumstances and needs of individuals and the promotion of justice and
   compassion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultimately, the question of what Jesus would say about immigration and border
   control is a matter of interpretation and belief, and people may hold a
   variety of different views on these issues based on their own understanding
   of Jesus' teachings and the guidance of their faith.
